# seeblock
Visual interpretation of what happen in a blockchain

You can input address or block number from the Ethereum blockchain and seeblock will display transactions in a graphic way.

# Get started
### Basic
Clone the project and `yarn`

### Getting the Ethereum blockchain
First, you need to have the Ethereum network injected in your browser. I suggest to use [Metamask](https://metamask.io/) web extansion (Chrome, Firefox). It will add blockchain context in the browser and seeblock will use it to perform it's requests.

### Starting the project
Fire `yarn dev`. It should open the app on `http://localhost:8080`.
